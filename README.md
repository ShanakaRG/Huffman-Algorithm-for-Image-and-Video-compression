# Huffman-Algorithm-for-Image-and-Video-compression

Huffman is a lossless image compression algorithm. Here i have developed a image compression codec using huffman algorithm in MATLAB. Design a Hybrid video coding framework which facilitates to H.264 Hybrid video codec. Implemented a hybrid video codec with coding tools such as discrete cosine transformation, quantization, prediction and entropy coding(Huffman coding) and the impact of each tool on the codecâ€™s performance was investigated. The system is improved to support video compression by using macroblock-based coding, basic estimation, and intra prediction

In image_done.m file is used to encode a RGB image sample_1.jpg and decode using Huffman algorithm. you can find this file in Image compressin folder

For video encoding and decoding code please  video compression folder and run Video_code.m
